# 🛡️ API Sentinel

**Security-First Reverse Proxy | Built with Go**

API Sentinel is a high-performance middleman designed to sit in front of your web applications. It doesn't just route traffic; it inspects, filters, and sanitizes it to strip away common web attacks like SQL Injection and XSS before they ever reach your backend.

## 🚀 The Vision
To build a production-grade security tool from absolute zero, documenting every step of the way from "Hello World" to "AppSec Pro".

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Go (Golang)
- **Core Library:** `net/http/httputil`
- **Design Philosophy:** Brutalist, effective, and secure.

## 📚 Educational Roadmap
We follow a 4-tier learning path:
1. **Beginner:** Understanding HTTP, Reverse Proxies, and basic routing.
2. **Intermediate:** Middleware patterns, rate limiting, and security headers.
3. **Advanced:** Payload inspection, RegEx-based WAF (Web Application Firewall) logic.
4. **Pro:** Observability, Dockerization, and Production Hardening.
